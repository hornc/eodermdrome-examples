# Eodermdrome examples

A collection of code examples written by me in the esoteric programming language [Eodermdrome](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Eodermdrome).
Eodermdrome is graph-rewriting Turing tarpit, which is quite unintuitive to program in.

Two interpreters are available: https://github.com/tadeboro/eodermdrome (in Python), and https://github.com/Jafet/drunken-octo-wallhack (in Haskell).

Neither interpreter originally supported punctionation, which my examples frequently use for layout and self-commenting.

I have a [fork of the Python interpreter which ignores punctuation](https://github.com/hornc/eodermdrome) according to the spec.
